set current map
event tiles?
portal tiles?

UDLR portal in and out transitions
	possibly sprites for portals - doors etc. not caves etc.
	maybe just walk animation for player - once portal is open.

// directional passing - logical way could be to check in and out each time - only if truthy

spriteAnimations

tap to turn, hold to walk - means sending new events.

interact button(s) - to start NPC chat etc.

NPCs... static and roaming? roaming could be hard, will need to set boundaries, ensure that the NPC can't walk over player and viceversa

ambient animated tiles

NPC / Situational sprites

Alternative control views
	Store,
	Options (ABC maybe?)
	Inventory? actual inventory will be on screen, but interaction could be different

Local storage for:
	Position
	Progress
	Inventory
	Etc.

// Pause ticker
	events for pause?

free up keys when needed
